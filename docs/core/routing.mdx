## üß≠ Router

For a simple `Router` component, use the `jaspr_router` package.

```shell
dart pub add jaspr_router
```

Use can use the `Router` component for some basic routing. It takes a list of `Route`s.
A simple use looks like this:

```dart
import 'pages/home.dart';
import 'pages/about.dart' ;

class App extends StatelessComponent {
  @override
  Iterable<Component> build(BuildContext context) sync* {
    yield Router(routes: [
      Route(path: '/', builder: (context, state) => Home()),
      Route(path: '/about', builder: (context, state) => About()),
    ]);
  }
}
```

<Info>
`jaspr_router` is adapted from the `go_router` flutter package. If you know `go_router` a lot of the core concepts
should feel familiar.

<Info>
These docs are currently **WIP**. Until they are done you can refer to the [go_router docs](https://pub.dev/documentation/go_router/latest/topics/Configuration-topic.html)
for orientation. Be aware that while many core concepts are similar, not everything will work exactly the same.
</Info>

To push a new route call `Router.of(context).push('/path');` inside your child components. Similarly, you can call `.replace()` or `.back()`.

## üê® Lazy Routes & Code Splitting

For larger web apps, we don't want to load everything together, but rather split our pages into smaller chunks.
`jaspr` can do this automatically using `LazyRoutes` and deferred imports.

To use lazy routes, change the above code to the following:

```dart
import 'pages/home.dart';
import 'pages/about.dart' deferred as about;

class App extends StatelessComponent {
  @override
  Iterable<Component> build(BuildContext context) sync* {
    yield Router(
      routes: [
        Route(path: '/', builder: (context, state) => Home()),
        Route.lazy(path: '/about', builder: (context, state) => about.About(), load: about.loadLibrary),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

This will lazy load the appropriate javascript files for the '/about' route when navigating to it.
