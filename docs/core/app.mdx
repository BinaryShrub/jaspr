## 🚀 Run your App

To run your app, use the `runApp` function and provide your root component.

```dart
runApp(MyComponent());
```

This function is not available under the normal `package:jaspr/jaspr.dart` import. Instead, you
must use the platform-specific `package:jaspr/browser.dart` or `package:jaspr/server.dart` import
in your web and server entrypoint, respectively.

We have separate imports since the `runApp` method works slightly different depending on whether
we are on the server or client.

1. **On the server** this starts a http server that renders the given component to html for every
   incoming request.
   
2. **On the client** this attaches the given component to the DOM and thereby making your app interactive.

Let's look at a simple example on how this works in practice. A minimal file structure looks like this:

```text
├── lib/
│   ├── app.dart
│   └── main.dart
└── web/
    └── main.dart
```

This consists of

- an `lib/app.dart` with an `App` component that we want to use both for server-side rendering and 
client-side hydration,
  
- a `lib/main.dart` file that is the entrypoint on the server for our app

    ```dart
    // Server-specific import
    import 'package:jaspr/server.dart';
    
    // Our main component
    import 'app.dart';
    
    void main() {
      // Starts the server and renders the app component
      runApp(
        // Special component that sets up the main document tags
        // like <html>, <head>, and <body>.
        // More on this later
        Document(
          // Renders the component inside the <body> tag
          body: App(),
        ),
      );
    }
    ```

- a `web/main.dart` file that is the entrypoint on the client for our app

  ```dart
  // Client-specific import
  import 'package:jaspr/browser.dart';
  
  // Our main component
  import 'lib/app.dart';
  
  void main() {
    // Attaches the app component to the <body> tag
    // and hydrates the component / makes it interactive.
    runApp(App(), attachTo: 'body');
  }
  ```

  It is important that you attach your component on the client to the same location in the tree 
  where you rendered it on the server. This does not need to be &lt;body&gt;, but must be the same.

## 📋 The Document

The `Document` component helps you to set up a basic document structure at the root of your app.
It renders the main `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` tags and takes a set of standard parameters, 
e.g. to set the `title` or `meta` attributes inside the `<head>`.

The standard `Document` constructor takes the following arguments:

- `String? title`: Sets the title of your website.
- `String? base`: Sets the `<base>` tag of your website.
- `String? charset`: Sets the charset, defaults to 'utf-8'.
- `String? viewport`: Sets the viewport for mobile devices, defaults to 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'.
- `Map<String, String>? meta`: Sets additional `<meta>` properties.
- `List<StyleRule>? styles`: A global set of style-rules, rendered as a `<style>` section inside `<head>`.
- `String? scriptName`: The name of the script that corresponds to your web entrypoint, e.g. `main` for `web/main.dart`.
- `List<Component> head`: Additional components to render inside `<head>`.
- `Component body`: The component to render inside `<body>`.

---

There are also one other constructors that you can use instead:

- **Document.file()** where you can use an external html file that defines the document markup.
  
  See the `classic` template for an example setup.

## 🧙‍Client Components

With the previous approach you have to manage the entry scripts for server and client manually.
However jaspr can also do that for you using the `@client` annotation.

Annotate a component that you want to be shipped and hydrated on the client with `@client` like this:

```dart
import 'package:jaspr/jaspr.dart';

// will be generated by jaspr
part 'app.g.dart';

// marks this as a client component
@client
class App extends StatelessComponent with _$App {
  @override
  Iterable<Component> build(BuildContext context) sync* {
    yield ...;
  }
}
```

When you use the **@client** annotation, your web entrypoints
will be automatically generated and used in your server-rendered markup.

Using this component in your server-rendered application anywhere in the tree under `Document()` will
automatically set up this component also on the client.
