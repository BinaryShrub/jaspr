# Jaspr

> A modern web framework for building websites in Dart with support for both **client-side** and **server-side rendering**.

- 🔮 **Why?**: Jaspr was made with the premise to make a web-framework that looks and feels just like Flutter, but
  renders normal html/css like Vue or React.
- 👥 **Who?**: Jaspr is targeted mainly at Flutter developers that want to build any type of websites
  (especially ones that are not suitable for Flutter Web).
- 🚀 **What?**: Jaspr wants to push the boundaries of Dart on the web and server, by giving you a thought-through fullstack
  web framework written completely in Dart.

> Want to contribute to Jaspr? Join our open [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/XGXrGEk4c6) of
> developers around Jaspr and check out the [Contributing Guide](https://docs.page/schultek/jaspr/eco/contributing).

### Core Features

- 💙 **Familiar**: Works with a similar component model to flutter widgets.
- 🏗 **Powerful**: Comes with server side rendering out of the box.
- ♻️ **Easy**: Syncs component state between server and client automatically.
- ⚡️ **Fast**: Performs incremental DOM updates only where needed.
- 🎛 **Flexible**: Runs on the server, client or both with manual or automatic setup. You decide.

> If you want to say thank you, star the project on GitHub and like the package on pub.dev 🙌💙

### Online Editor & Playground

Inspired by DartPad, **Jaspr** has it's own online editor and playground, called **JasprPad**.

[Check it out here!](https://jasprpad.schultek.de)

You can check out the samples, take the tutorial or try out jaspr for yourself, all live in the browser.
When you want to continue coding offline, you can quickly download the current files bundled in a complete dart project, ready to start coding locally.

JasprPad is also built with **Jaspr** itself, so you can [**check out its source code**](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/tree/main/apps/jaspr_pad) to get a feel for how jaspr would be used in a larger app.

- [Framework](#framework)
- [Differences to Flutter(-Web)](#differences-to-flutter-web)
- [Building](#building)
- [Testing](#testing)

## Get Started

To get started simply activate the `jasper_cli` command line tool and run `jaspr create`:

```shell
dart pub global activate jaspr_cli
jaspr create my_web_app
```

Next, run the development server using the following command:

```shell
cd my_web_app
dart run jaspr serve
```

This will spin up a server at `localhost:8080`. You can now start developing your web app. 
Also observe that the browser automatically refreshes the page when you change something in your code, like the `Hello World` text.

## CLI Tool

Jaspr comes with a cli tool to create, serve and build your web app.

- `jaspr create my_web_app` will create a new jaspr project inside the `my_web_app` directory
- `jaspr serve` will serve the web-app in the current directory, including hot-reloading
- `jaspr build` will build the web-app containing the static web assets (compiled js, html, ...) and the server executable

## Framework

Jaspr was developed with the premise to look and feel just like Flutter. Therefore when you know Flutter
you probably already know jaspr (in large parts).

The core building block of UIs build with jaspr are **Components**. These are just what you know 
as **Widgets** from Flutter. jaspr comes with all three base types of Components, namely:

- **StatelessComponent**: A basic component that has a single build method.
- **StatefulComponent**: A component that holds state and can trigger rebuilds using `setState()`.
- **InheritedComponent**: A component that can notify its dependents when its state changes.

In addition to these base components, there are two more components that don't exist in Flutter:

- **DomComponent**: A component that renders any HTML element given a tag, attributes and events.
  ```dart
  var component = DomComponent(
    tag: 'div',
    id: 'my-id',
    classes: ['class-a', 'class-b'],
    attributes: {'my-attribute': 'my-value'},
    events: {'click': (e) => print('clicked')},
    children: [
      ...
    ],
  );
  ```
  
- **Text**: A simple component that renders a text node.
  `var text = Text('Hello World!');`

## Differences to Flutter(-Web)

As you might know Flutter renders Widgets by manually painting pixels to a canvas. However rendering web-pages
with HTML & CSS works fundamentally different to Flutters painting approach. Also Flutter has a vast variety
of widgets with different purposes and styling, whereas in html you can uniquely style each html element however
you like.

Instead of trying to mirror every little thing from Flutter, `jaspr` tries to give a general Fluttery feeling
by matching features where it makes sense without compromising on the unique properties of the web platform.
Rather it embraces these differences to give the best of both worlds.

1. The `build()` method of a `StatelessComponent` or `StatefulComponent` returns an `Iterable<Component>` 
   instead of a single component. This is because a HTML element can always have multiple child elements.
   The recommended way of using this is with a [**synchronous generator**](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#generators). 
   Simply use the `sync*` keyword in the method definition and `yield` one or multiple components:
   
   ```dart
   class MyComponent extends StatelessComponent {
     @override
     Iterable<Component> build(BuildContext context) sync* {
       yield ChildA();
       yield ChildB();
     } 
   }
   ```
   
   *Trade-Off: Returning a single component and having an extra multi-child component would be superficial 
   to how html works and thereby not a good practice.*
   
2. Jaspr does not care about the styling of components. There are (currently) no prestyled components
   like in Flutters material or cupertino libraries.
   
   *Trade-Off: Providing styled components would be a lot of extra work and is currently not feasible.
    Also there exist a lot of different, well established CSS frameworks for web that you can already
    integrate and use with jaspr (e.g. [Bulma](https://jasprpad.schultek.de/?sample=bulma).*
   
3. `Text` receives only a `String` and nothing else. As usual for web, styling is done through a combination
   of CSS attributes, either in a **Stylesheet** or though the **`style` attribute** of the parent elements. 
   
   *Trade-Off: Giving `Text` a style option would be superficial and not native to web, and thereby not
    a good practice.*
   
## Building

You can build your application using the following command:

```shell
dart run jaspr build
```

This will build the app inside the `build` directory. 
You can choose whether to build a standalone executable or an aot or jit snapshot with the `--target` option.

To run your built application do:

```shell
cd build
./app
```

## Testing

`jaspr` comes with it's own testing package `jaspr_test`.
It is built as a layer on top of `package:test` and has a similar api to `flutter_test`.

A simple component test looks like this:

```dart
import 'package:jaspr_test/jaspr_test.dart';

import 'app.dart';

void main() {
  group('simple component test', () {
    late ComponentTester tester;

    setUp(() {
      tester = ComponentTester.setUp();
    });

    test('should render component', () async {
      await tester.pumpComponent(App());

      expect(find.text('Count: 0'), findsOneComponent);

      await tester.click(find.tag('button'));

      expect(find.text('Count: 1'), findsOneComponent);
    });
  });
}
```

For more examples on how to use the testing package, check out the 
[documentation](https://docs.page/schultek/jaspr/testing) and the 
[tests in the jaspr package](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/tree/main/packages/jaspr/test).
