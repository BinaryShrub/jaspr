# element_embedding_demo

This package contains the application used to demonstrate the
new Flutter web feature: "Element Embedding" in combination with 
the [jaspr](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr) web framework.

This was first shown on the Flutter Forward event in Nairobi (Kenya), by Tim
Sneath. [See the replay here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKQYGKAe5W8&t=5799s).
The original implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/flutter/samples/tree/main/web_embedding/element_embedding_demo)

## Running the demo

The demo is a jaspr app with an embedded flutter web app. 
It can be run with:

```terminal
$ jaspr serve --input=lib/main_jaspr.dart --flutter=lib/main_flutter.dart
```

* Check the entrypoints for both dart apps
  * For flutter: `lib/main_flutter.dart`
  * For jaspr: `lib/main_jaspr.dart` and `web/main_jaspr.dart`

* Check the new JS Interop:
  * Look at `lib/shared/app_state.dart` and `lib/interop/state.dart`.
  * Find the `appStateProvider` and where it is used
    * `lib/components/interop_controls.dart` for the jaspr app
    * `lib/main_flutter.dart` for the flutter app

* See how the Flutter web application is embedded into the page now:
  * Find `FlutterTarget` in `lib/components/flutter_target.dart`.
